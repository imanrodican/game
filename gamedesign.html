                </p>
            </ul>
     <h1>Game Directions</h1>
        <h3>Setting up the Game</h3>
            <p>Each player should begin with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A game board</li>
                    <li>One regular-type shelf</li>
                    <li>Two five-dollar Retail Bucks</li>
                    <li>One ten-dollar Retail Bucks</li>
                    <li>One twenty-dollar Retail Bucks</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3>Taking Turns</h3>
            <p>
                On each turn, the player must scan both the yellow card, which generates a regular-type event, and the blue card, which 
                generates a special-type event. The player must complete the action prompted by the generate event (i.e. gaining Retail
                Bucks or losing Retail Bucks). Players can only gain Retail Bucks from shelves that are on their game board. 
                If the player chooses, they can purchase one shelf or one register for 50 Retail Bucks. Should the player chose to 
                purchase a register, they have hired an employee, and must pay them a 10 Retail Buck-wage every turn. However, players
                with an employee gain a 5 Retail Buck bonus on every regular transaction and a 15 Retail Buck bonus on every special
                transaction. 
            </p>
        <h3>Ending the Game</h3>
            <p>
                The game ends after each player has taken 15 turns 
            </p>
