        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Iman Rodican. I am 15, and a junior at ESUMS. My favorite games are Wii Sports, Mario Kart, and Spades (the card game). 
          I would say that I am pretty competitive, especially when I'm up against my friends or siblings, which explains my gamer types (listed below).
        </p>
