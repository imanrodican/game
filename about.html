                    the levels of the game.

                <p>
                My name is Ryan Teutle. I am a student at the Engineering and Science Unviersity Magnet School in New Haven. Some of my favorite games growing
                up were the Nintendo Mario franchise, whether it be the older games such Super Mario World for the SNES or the newer variations.

            <h3>Ryan's Definition of a Game</h3>
                <p>
                    When I think of game's definition, I like to think that a game is something which can be played with others of by yourself, whether it be for fun or
                    for a challenging experience. Games are meant to be entertaining and they serve that purpose to bring you joy and happiness while you play them.
